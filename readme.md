# Homework

Read over the code we did today. Don't be afraid to refer to it, but try not to copy / paste (except for config stuff like webpack).

- make a very simple mongo database of your choosing.

- create a seed file (use a database dropDatabase, insert some documents)
You can use mongo < seed_data.js (with mongod running in its own tab) to seed (and test) the database
Serve up this data in an API.

- create a server.js with express with index and <your resource> controllers that use the express Router
- make a Query Helper. It should have functions to return the expected data (e.g. all returns all documents for that resource / collection)
- these functions connect to the database find and convert toArray (via callbacks).
- Then run the callback provided in next step supplying the docs as an argument each route should use a Query Helper to get the necessary data from the database and provide a callback to the Query Helper that uses the res object to send() back JSON

EXTENSION: If you feel ambitious, make a client / UI for your data

- write a XMLHttpRequest helper - client/helpers/requestHelper.js
- Call your API request model from the file where you need the data - client/app.js
- Configure webpack to turn your 'source' code into bundle.js
- Write the request to your own API on the back-end (using your requestHelper) and create DOM elements to display the response/s

## Notes

If you get this error message"

"Unable to lock file: /data/db/mongod.lock Resource temporarily unavailable. Is a mongod instance already running?, terminating"

you probably didn't close mongod cleanly and you can quit mongod using Activity Monitor

If you get -

Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000

You either have an express server running in another tab. Or the server did not quit properly - in which case use Activity Monitor to quit node
